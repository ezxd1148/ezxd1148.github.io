# 🛡️ Afdhal Saufi | Security Architect & Systems Builder

> "I don't just run automated scanners; I build them from the ground up." 

I'm a PERMATA@Pintar scholar from Sabah, Malaysia, turning my obsession with low-level systems into indestructible security architectures. While most people are trying to figure out how to *use* standard cyber tools, I'm writing custom engines in **Nim, Rust, and C++** to outpace them. 

My current mission? Speedrunning the gap between "student" and "Senior VAPT Engineer." I am currently self-funding my university goals through freelance security work and side jobs. When I'm not auditing smart contracts, crushing CTFs, or building custom Linux distros, I'm probably playing chess or speedcubing. 

### ⚙️ The Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Nim, Rust, C++, Python, Solidity
* **Blockchain:** Polkadot (PolaVM), Smart Contract Auditing
* **Security:** VAPT, Custom Exploit Dev, Network Forensics, Cryptography (AES-GCM/X25519)
* **Environment:** Arch Linux (yes, I use Arch btw), LFS, GNS3

## 🚀 The Arsenal (Featured Projects)

### 1. 👁️‍🗨️ Sentinel | AI-Driven Web3 Security Agent
* **Stack:** Nim, Python, Solidity, Polkadot
A hybrid decentralized application (dApp) that acts as an autonomous security agent. Sentinel uses a high-speed Nim engine to monitor network telemetry, instantly encrypts forensic logs, and anchors immutable "receipts" to the Polkadot blockchain. Includes an AI layer for zero-trust threat mitigation.

### 2. ⚡ Tinjau | High-Speed Network Port Scanner
* **Stack:** Nim, Low-Level TCP/UDP
A proprietary, ultra-fast port scanning utility written entirely in Nim. Designed to bypass the bloat of standard scanners, optimizing concurrent network probing to map attack surfaces with surgical precision.

### 3. 🗡️ Keris | CTF & Vulnerability Automation Framework
* **Stack:** Nim, Python
An automated offensive security framework designed to streamline Capture The Flag (CTF) ops and vulnerability assessments. Automates payload delivery, system recon, and exploit chaining.

### 4. 🤖 ExakBot | Telegram Triage Bot
* **Stack:** Python, API Integration
A real-time URL scanner and triage bot built for Telegram, instantly analyzing and neutralizing malicious links before users click them. 

### 5. 🅿️ BrillyPark | Smart Infrastructure System 🥇
* **Stack:** IoT, Python, Systems Architecture
Engineered the backend logic for an advanced smart parking assignment system. Optimized real-time vehicle flow and secured data pipelines between hardware sensors and the central database. 
* *Awarded Gold Medal at ISTEC 2025.*
